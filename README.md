# DrawInAir ✨

DrawInAir is an innovative project that lets you sketch and interact with digital canvases using natural gestures in the air. It combines computer vision, machine learning, and intuitive design to create a seamless drawing experience without traditional input devices.

## 🚀 Features
- **Air-Gesture Drawing** – Use hand movements to draw directly in the air, captured by camera input.  
- **Real-Time Recognition** – Smooth tracking of gestures with minimal latency.  
- **Customizable Tools** – Choose brush styles, colors, and stroke thickness.  
- **Shape Detection** – Automatically refine rough sketches into clean geometric shapes.  
- **Export Options** – Save your creations as images or vector files.  
- **Cross-Platform** – Works across desktop and mobile environments with camera support.
